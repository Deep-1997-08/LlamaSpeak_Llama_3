# LlamaSpeak

This project demonstrates the setup and usage of the Meta-Llama-3 model using Hugging Face's `transformers` library, along with `torch`, `accelerate`, and `bitsandbytes` for efficient model handling and quantization.

## Project Overview

LlamaSpeak is a project focused on leveraging the capabilities of the Meta-Llama-3 model, a state-of-the-art language model developed by Meta AI. This project includes steps to authenticate with Hugging Face, initialize the model with specific quantization settings for optimized performance, tokenize inputs, and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.

### Key Features:
- **Quantized Model Loading:** Efficient model loading using 4-bit quantization.
- **Tokenization:** Handling input tokenization for seamless interaction with the model.
- **Response Generation:** Generating responses from the model based on provided input text.

## Usage

### 1. Authentication

Before you can use the Meta-Llama-3 model, you need to authenticate with Hugging Face to access the necessary resources.

```python
from google.colab import userdata
hf_token_key = userdata.get('HF_TOKEN')
